## The following repository contains the following 12 files:

 1. 'Plot_Fig2.R' The R-script to recreate panels B-D for figure 2 showing the structure of information-sharing in relation to turtle bycatch. Note that panel A of Figure 2 was generated in ArcGIS and integrated using Abobe Illustrator. 
 
 2. 'Plot_Fig3.R' The R-script to recreate figure 3 showing the observed correlation (and the correlations expected under the null models)between the turtle bycatch information-sharing network with all the other information networks.
 
 3. 'Plot_Fig4.R' The R-script to recreate Supplementary Information figure S1 showing illustrative networks of the structure of information sharing across contexts. 
 
 4. 'Plot_Fig5.R' The R-script to recreate Supplementary Information figure S2 showing the observed assortativity coefficient for outgoing links in comparison to the null distributions for the different information-sharing networks.
 
 5. 'Plot_Fig6.R' The R-script to recreate Supplementary Information figure S3 showing the observed variance in node betweenness in comparison to the null distributions for the different information-sharing networks.
 
 6. 'Plot_Fig7.R' The R-script to recreate Supplementary Information figure S4 showing the observed mean node eccentricity in comparison to the null distributions for the different information-sharing networks.
 
 7. 'Plot_Fig8.R' The R-script to recreate Supplementary Information figure S5 showing the observed variance in node eccentricity in comparison to the null distributions (generated from the context permutations) for the different information-sharing networks.
 
 8. 'Plot_Fig8.R' The R-script to recreate Supplementary Information figure S6 showing the observed mean node eccentricity in comparison to the null distributions (generated from the context permutations) for the different information-sharing networks.

9. 'Plot_Fig9.R' The R-script to recreate Supplementary Information figure S7 showing context differences to the ‘any’ nomination network.

10. 'Plot_Fig10.R' The R-script to recreate Supplementary Information figure S8 showing output for evaluation of context null model 2.

11. 'Plot_Fig11.R' The R-script to recreate Supplementary Information figure S9 showing observed correlation (and the correlation expected from the context permutations) between all of the information-sharing networks.

12. 'Plot_Fig12.R' The R-script to recreate Supplementary Information figure S10 showing observed correlation (and the correlation expected from the edge permutations) between all of the information-sharing networks.
